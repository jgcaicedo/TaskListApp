Welcome to TaskListApp
This is a new React Native project, bootstrapped using @react-native-community/cli.

Getting Started
Note: Before proceeding, ensure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step.

Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that comes with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
Step 2: Start Your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
```bash
Copiar código
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
For iOS
```bash
Copiar código
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

You can also run the app directly from within Android Studio or Xcode.

Step 3: Modifying Your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, you can modify it as follows:

Open App.js in your preferred text editor and make some changes.

For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes!

For iOS: Press <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

Congratulations! :tada:
You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
